Head motion-based interfaces for controlling robot arms in
real time have been presented in both medical-oriented research as well as human-robot interaction. We present an
especially minimal and low-cost solution that uses the eSense [1] ear-worn prototype as a small head-worn controller,
enabling direct control of an inexpensive robot arm in the
environment. We report on the hardware and software setup,
as well as the experiment design and early results
